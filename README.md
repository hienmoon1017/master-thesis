# Research Process:

The research was conducted in two stages: preliminary and formal research.

- **Preliminary Research**: This involved **qualitative research through in-depth interviews**. The purpose was to explore the ideas of interviewees directly, refine measurement scales, and develop the official questionnaire. Seven participants were interviewed. The interviews were analyzed to adjust and enhance the measurement scales.
- **Formal Research**: This involved quantitative research using a **Likert scale questionnaire (5 levels: 1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree)**. Data collected were analyzed using **SPSS 20** and **AMOS 20**.
