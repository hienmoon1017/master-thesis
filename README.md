# Master's Thesis, Statistical Model Testing with SPSS and AMOS (EFA, CFA, SEM, etc)
My thesis, **Factors Affecting the Intention to Continue Using the Social Network Facebook**, was successfully defended to obtain my MBA in February 2017.

# Research Objectives
The objective of this thesis is to examine how factors affect the Continued Intention to Use Facebook

# Research Questions
- What factors influence the intention to continue using Facebook?
- Which of these factors is the most important?
- Are there differences in the factors affecting the intention to continue using Facebook based on personal characteristics such as gender and extroversion?

# Research Process:

The research was conducted in two stages: preliminary and formal research.

- **Preliminary Research**: This involved **qualitative research through in-depth interviews**. The purpose was to explore the ideas of interviewees directly, refine measurement scales, and develop the official questionnaire. Seven participants were interviewed. The interviews were analyzed to adjust and enhance the measurement scales.
- **Formal Research**: This involved quantitative research using a **Likert scale questionnaire (5 levels: 1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree)**. Data collected were analyzed using **SPSS 20** and **AMOS 20**.

#Results and Conclusion
By running these Statistical Testing:
- **Cronbach’s Alpha**: Reliability tested with **SPSS**.
- Exploratory Factor Analysis (**EFA**): Conducted using **SPSS** to identify factor structure.
- Confirmatory Factor Analysis (**CFA**): Evaluated with **AMOS** for model fit, unidimensionality, convergent validity, discriminant validity, composite reliability, and average variance extracted.
- Structural Equation Modeling (**SEM**): Tested with **AMOS** to validate the research model.
- **Multi-Group Analysis**: Performed with** Chi-square test** to assess differences across groups.

**The results are:**
Cronbach’s Alpha confirms all scales are reliable. Factor analysis (EFA) removed one variable, but Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) showed all variables meet the requirements, and the model fits the market data. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) accepted most hypotheses. Multi-group analysis revealed no differences between variable-change and invariant models by gender and extroversion.

**Conclusion:**

- **Framework Proposal:** This study proposes a theoretical framework combining motivation and external network theories to explore factors affecting Facebook usage intentions. The model effectively predicts users' intentions to continue using Facebook.
- **Key Findings:**
- **Number of Peers, Perceived External Prestige, Perceived Complementarity, Perceived Compatibility, Usefulness, and Enjoyment** explain **80.1%** of the variance in usage intention. Usefulness has the highest positive impact (standardized regression coefficient of **0.502**). Users who find Facebook useful are more likely to continue using it and recommend it to others.
- **Perceived External Prestige, Perceived Complementarity, and Perceived Compatibility** positively impact Usefulness, explaining **67%** of its variance. Supplementarity has the greatest impact (standardized coefficient of** 0.486**). Facebook’s value in sharing content and engaging in communities enhances its perceived usefulness.
- **Number of Peers, Perceived External Prestige, and Perceived Complementarity** positively affect Enjoyment, explaining **46.3%** of its variance. **Number of Peers** has the strongest effect (standardized coefficient of **0.374**). Facebook helps users connect and maintain relationships, contributing to their enjoyment.
